         Oregon State University has had a growing issue with the process of handling letters of recommendation a long with the necessary information to create them. The issue presented has occurred due to the rapidly growing student body at the university which in relation has resulted in a larger amount of request for letters from the professors of the institute. In order to handle the growing issue a solution was proposed to develop a web application to handle all requests as well as information transfer between students and professors to smooth out a complex process. In this document there will be a retrospective on the past few weeks of planning that went into developing the application and the corresponding documents.

\section{Document Purpose}
The purpose of this progress report is to demonstrate the current progress and standpoint of the given project. A brief recap of the project's purpose and goals will be provided a long with a in-depth week by week analysis displayed within a retrospective table which will contain the positives, deltas, and action taken during those specific weeks. The document will end with a conclusion that will state the teams current standpoint and future plans for the project. 

\section{Conclusion}
Currently with all the necessary documents complete the team now has a foundation to begin building the student letter of recommendation management site. The project will be built with Python and Python's popular framework Django to implement the functionality of our web application while we implement bootstrap to help design the two user interfaces. Our database will be built using MySQL and will establish a connection to the Oregon State University servers to match accounts with files. Security will be implemented at all levels to ensure a safe environment for our users. With the provided tools development can begin and we will star to meet the set goals for the project.
