    \section{Brief Introduction}
    Oregon State University has rapidly growing student population, with such an increase professors have been over encumbered by requests for letters of recommendation. In order to remedy the issue, professor Justin Wolford provided the team the solution of developing a web application to allow student's and professors to collaborate in the process of creating letters of recommendation.As a result of this project the teams was able to learn value web development skills that can be translated to future job positions while also being exposed to some industry utilized tools. Throughout the rest of the file you will find all the documentation developed during our time with the project as well as other necessary artifacts to help provide information to our client and end users.\\
