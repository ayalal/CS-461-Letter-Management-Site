\subsection{Spring}
\subsubsection{Week 1}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
Since the start of spring we have been able to get the cas team to add our service url to their developer instance so we can add that functionality and begin to finish up our app. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent None so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent This weekend we plan on meeting up and finishing up our project so that we can finalize everything.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Forgot we still had these progress reports since they had a slightly different name to them. We spent a lot of time meeting up and working on the project. Now that the database is running, we're able to implement and test various functionality. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent We are still not really connected to CAS so we have to manually test student and professor accounts by hard coding them in and manually privileges.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We are planning on continuing to work on this until all the functionality is completed. We may plan on meeting up again over the weekend or even during the week to finish up.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We met with Omeed this week and are planning on meeting up on Saturday and Sunday to get as much of our project done as possible. It should consist mostly of just putting all of the parts together and connecting them to the database.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent We haven't had any problems.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We will meet up to further discuss plans for the term.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We have gotten our project setup with AWS and it has been approved to work with OSU's CAS. Also, since we have AWS setup, we now have a working url.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We are meeting this weekend to get the CAS package installed for Django so we can connect with OSU's CAS system. We are also going to hammer out some database management and more key functionality and bring the project together by the end of the weekend.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
 Since the code freeze part is due the week three, the team will working on the final project structure building together this weekend. Everything should be done before next weekend. After testing the final work, the team will prepare the client verification and make some change according to the feedback from the client.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Everything is good. The only part we need to be fixed is setting AWS this weekend. We will find final problems when we get together. Everything should be done this weekend.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Setting all things together this weekend. And prepare the final test.\\

\subsubsection{Week 2}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
So far we have continued to work on our application with most of the features implemented.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent None at all and i don't see any in the future.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent The group plans to begin development on the project during the three day weekend and continue our weekly Wednesday meetings.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We have been working on the project a little bit during the week. The preferences portion just needs to be visible, taking the input is already there. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No new problems from last time. We still don't have CAS completely integrated with our website but that's ok, we can still demo what we have so far because it'll integrate nicely once we do have CAS up and running.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We were planning on meeting over the weekend to get this finished. I think all we really have left to do (barring extreme complications) is just finishing touches on our project.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We accomplished a lot last over the last week. We have the AWS EC2 instance up and running as well as the database. Most of the functionality has been connected to the database as well.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent We haven't had any problems.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We are meeting up again this weekend to finish as much as we can, such as getting CAS set up.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We have gotten almost all of the key functionality done, we just need to implement the request system which we will do this weekend.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We are meeting this weekend to finish the last bit of functionality and also setup the repo for the code freeze.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
On the first week, our team takes the final review on our project and perfect the code part. Since I left my laptop on my friend's car, I didn't really help them in the code part last week. For this week, I was working on the service environment building and perfect the database connection. Everything should be done before this Saturday. Also, the team will meet again this weekend for code submission and project certification by the client next week.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Everything is good.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Setting all things together this weekend and finish the code submission. Get prepared on poster design and report work.\\

\subsubsection{Week 3}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
This week the team has taken care of the requirements for the code freeze which happened this past Monday. We also contacted our client whom of which read and approved our revised documents which have been submitted to the module and posted on Github as required. \\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent *No input*\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent For future plans we will revise our poster which will need to be approved by next Friday and the group plans on tying up some final knots on the project which we will then polish the looks of so we are prepared for Expo which will be coming in the next few weeks. The group will most likely meet up on the weekends to continue work on the project.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We finished coding our project for the code freeze, now we just need to implement CAS into our website and fix our code so that it works with CAS. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems so far. Expo deadline is approaching.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We were planning on putting more work into the project, might get together and make it look nice and pretty for expo once we have CAS set up nicely.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We met up last weekend to finish up for the code freeze. We still have a few more things to do before expo, such as adding CAS support and fixing some bugs, but we are almost done. We also sent the revised documents to our client for verification.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Other than a few bugs in the last minute code, we have not had any notable issues.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Our plans are to revise our poster and continue work on our code to make sure it is completely finished by expo.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We were able to turn in our code for the code freeze, we are planning to working on a few bugs, functionality, CAS, and making it look better.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Our main focus is adding in some of the last functionality and making the website look as clean and usable as possible.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
 On the last week, our team finishes the last review of our project code and finish the submission. Code part still waiting for the feedback from our client. This week, our team make the document revisions and sent to the client for the client's verification. The project may need to make some improvement once we get some report from Justin. Next week, the team would be working on the final project review including the final poster work since Friday is the deadline.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Everything is good. Waiting for the feedback from the client.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Make the final poster review next week.\\

\subsubsection{Week 4}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
Recently we have done some edits to our poster which we will submit today for the final review. We also have planned to meet this weekend to continue working on our project to prepare it for expo. \\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent No problems at all we just need to turn in the necessary paperwork for the expo.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent Future plans consist of meeting over the next few weeks to finish up and polish our project for the expo which we plan on completing the paperwork for soon.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Not much this week. Been focusing on other work. Looked over the poster we had. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems, project mostly finished up to specs at this point.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We were actually planning on meeting over the weekend again and review what we have and work on it.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We didn't do a whole lot this week other than finish our poster. We are meeting up tomorrow to continue work on our project to get it ready for expo.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Our plans are to continue work on our code to make sure it is completely finished by expo.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\

We submitted our final poster to our client for his approval this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We plan to meet up this weekend so we can go over some functionality and make the site look cleaner. We are still in the process of working on our request system and allowing professors to accept/deny requests.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
On the last week, our team gets the feedback from our client that we need setting the new UI and function that professor can refuse or decline the recommendation letter requirement from the student. We talk about the method of solving this missing part last weekend. Since team member all pretty busy this week, we push the modification meeting on this Saturday and Friday. We also made the new poster and waiting for the review and feedback from our client and Kirsten. Everything is on the process. Next week, the team might meet TA and client again for the new version project that fills the missing function one.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent  Everything is good. Just need to fix the missing function and waiting for the client's feedback.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Waiting for the poster feedback on next week and looking forward to the EXPO SHOW.\\

\subsubsection{Week 5}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
Over the last week we have been working on the functionality of the website in terms of allowing professors to accept and reject letters while also doing some polishing on the UI. \\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent *No input*\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent We plan to continue polishing the application and plan on integrating CAS login sometime this weekend so that we will have all our requirements met for the project. \\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We met up once to look over the project. Lorenzo handed us the expo forms to sign and turn in. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Lorenzo was planning on taking a look at the CAS implementation and see if it can be done within a reasonable time.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We met up last weekend to work on our project. I have been very busy with midterms this week, so I did not get much done with the project this week. We are mostly just finishing things up, so there isn't much to do anyway.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We will probably meet up again next weekend to get everything finished for expo.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Kept working on CAS implementation and request system.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent CAS is becoming a pain to implement and is proving more challenging than we had expected.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent To continue tidying up the project and finishing some loose ends before expo.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
 On the last week, our team adding the missing function of our project on the original one. Everything should be good this Monday.  This week, Kirsten ask us to fix the poster structure. Our leader already helps us contact the Kirsten and fixed it on Thursday. We all sent the personal bust shot to him, the poster part should be done.  Next week, looks like we have the class required attendance, Kirsten might talking about the expo things. \\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Everything is good. Time to expo if there is anything need to change.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent  Waiting for the team feedback and looking forward to the EXPO SHOW.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Lorenzo told me he had implemented CAS into the website. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent I completely forgot about the TA meeting last week since I got my even and odd weeks mixed up. I asked my teammates about it though and they told me I didn't miss much.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We are all planning on meeting over the weekend to see how the website looks and work on it again before expo.\\
