\subsection{Winter}
\subsubsection{Week 1}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
The group has begun discussing meeting times to establish for both group and TA development/discussion.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent  No problems at all the group works well together as usual.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent After establishing meeting times development on the project will proceed.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Emailing group members to determine a meetup time every week with the TA. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent There are time conflicts with the times the TA has given us.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We can try asking the TA for more times. Otherwise, we may have to schedule a time where not every one of our group members can make it.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
There isn't much to report because it is the first week of the term, so we are still working on getting organized.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent A minor problem we are facing is we all have very different schedules this term, which results in us experiencing some difficulty finding a time that we can have our weekly meeting with our TA.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We will focus on getting organized after the break and find a time that works for all of us to meet up.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Our group did not spend any time working on our project over the break. This week we are figuring out a time to meet with out new TA, and comparing schedules to see who is available at what times.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We plan to start implementation on the project soon, according to the plans we created last term.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Schedule the meeting time with our Capstone TA Omeed in next week. Start working on my part for project building. Get ready for some questions about database build when we meet the TA.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Team still not make the final decision for the meeting time next week. And also, the project detail may need to talk with our customer more and get some advice from him.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent  Email my teammates ask their free time next week to meet our TA and ask them whether to make an appointment with our customer.\\


\subsubsection{Week 2}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
We met up with the TA and discussed the project. Established that 4pm on Wednesdays is our meetup time.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent No problems at all with the group or on the project yet.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent The group plans to begin development on the project during the three day weekend and continue our weekly Wednesday meetings.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We met up with the TA and discussed the project. Established that 4pm on Wednesdays is our meetup time. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Lorenzo mentioned he might start some implementation this weekend and email us.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We have made progress on the early draft of our poster. Having a template made it much easier.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent We haven't had any problems this week other than still working on getting organized for the term.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Our plans for the week are to work on our elevator pitch and decide what language we want to use for our project. At the meeting with our TA, we discussed possible using either PHP or Python.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We met with our TA and are working to get started on implementation. We also discussed elevator pitches and the poster.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We plan to start implementation on the project soon, according to the plans we created last term. This weekend we will be working on posters as well.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
his week Wednesday is our first time meeting with our project TA. Our group asks him to provide some advice about the project detail and double check every part of our plan is in the right way. And because I am taking CS440 database class, it's good for me to design our database with professor's help.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Confirm the teamwork scheduling process next week. Ask my database professor how to design the database to avoid too many user logging crashes the website.\\

\subsubsection{Week 3}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
For week 3 we have looked at templates we could replicate to create the final product for our project and met up with Omeed to discuss this. \\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent None whatsoever and don't see any in the future.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent We will begin implementing our project this weekend and hopefully get a good start on it. \\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Confirmed that we have class on Tuesday at around 8:40am. Lorenzo created and shared the poster to group members. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Make a decent elevator pitch for class.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This was a slow week for us, so we didn't have much progress. We created the poster draft and are currently working on the elevator pitch.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent We haven't had any problems this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent This weekend we are planning to finish the elevator pitch. We haven't definitively decided what programming language we are going to use for the implementation yet, but we are leaning towards Python and the Django framework. I am planning on doing some research and a little experience with Django this weekend.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Beginning implementation on project. Looking at how to make it work with OSU's authentication system. Completed the poster rough draft\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Continue to work on the project. Will be ready for the elevator pitch next week.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
 This week team complete the early poster of our project. For our project, I can complete the fundamental database structure this weekend. \\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent  Next week Tuesday, prepare team elevator patch and finish the basic structure of project database design. Then, ask some advice from team member after they take a look. Asking other teammates overseeing their part and review their recent process.\\

\subsubsection{Week 4}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
For this week we have began developing the application for our client with further development happening.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent Not at all as usual.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent The group plans on meeting this weekend to delegate responsibilities for each other and continue working on our project. \\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We're using Django for our project. We found a group to do our poster critique. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We are currently in the middle of an email thread to confirm a time that everyone is good with in both groups. I believe we have a time or are very close to securing a time.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
I followed the tutorial on the Django website to familiarize myself with the framework. We found another group to do the poster critique with and are working on organizing a time that works for everyone.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent We haven't had any problems this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We are planning on meeting up this weekend to discuss our plans and begin our implementation.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We have a basic layout of the front-end and are continuing to work on the back-end of the website and develop the database.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent I attended the required class period to go over elevator pitches and turned in the small slip with my noted from that class period, but the elevator pitch assignment is showing as a 0 for me. Dr. Winters said she was going to check her files, but it has been a few days and the grade hasn't been changed.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We are going to keep working on the project and we are planning to meet as a group this weekend to see where we are at.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This week team participates the elevator pitch and share the project information with other teams. During the pitch time, our team also find another group would come prepares the poster critique activity with us next week. For our project, I start reading some advanced database design this week. Also, our team leader Ayala sounds like finish the backend part when we meet during the TA meeting time. Other team members still working on other parts of the project.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Everything is good. Kirsten said, we need work 12 hours per week, I think I need to work harder. Again, the only problem I am worried about is the project schedule. \\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Both group still discuss the appropriate time of poster critique activity next week. We will make the final decision Friday before the due time. My plan for next week is to figure out how is my database design and whether need modify and perfect.\\

\subsubsection{Week 5}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
We have started developing features of our app  which were delegated among team members.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent None at all and none can be seen in the future.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent The group plans on meeting with our client to setup the CAS login so we can continue development.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We did our poster critique with another group. I got my Django set up and am currently working on the website. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Just get some work on the website.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We are now in the very early stages of implementing our project. We have a single page with a basic theme that is mostly just getting Django set up properly.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Other than the little annoyances of learning a new programming language and framework, there have not been any notable problems.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We each have a rough idea of what we need to work on in the coming days and weeks. I am currently working on creating a rough template for the scheduling page that instructors will use to keep track of when each letter is due.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We have added to the basic server. Personally, I set up a very simple file upload system, which will probably be modified once the database is added.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We will continue to work on the server, and will probably see our client sometime in the next 1 or 2 weeks in order to work out the OSU CAS system to get accounts set up on our site.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This week team participates the Poster critique meeting with Professor Kirsten and another team in KEC. Both groups share the feedback about each poster design and professor help us perfect the Poster structure. For our project, I already finish the database design and team ask me to do the backend setup. Since I haven't learn python before, I need to learn it at least one week to start working on it later. Also, other team members sound like working on other parts of the project as well.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Everything is good. And this week I might need more time work on my midterm review. Project backend setup study will delay after exam finish. After midterm, i would ask my teammates about the plan of making the winter term reporting work.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Asking my teammates about the design of building the winter term reporting work. Figure out how to set up the backend by python and connect the other part my teammates did in the future.\\

\subsubsection{Week 6}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
Currently we have our web app functioning with some basic features and have met up with our client Justin to discuss the CAS login setup.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent None so far but maybe some in the future with CAS but we have a number of resources to help.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent Polish up our web application and look over django CAS packages for implementing the login this next week. \\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Still just working on the project. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Meeting up with our client on Friday to check some miscellaneous things such as CAS setup.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We met with our client this week to discuss our plans integrating with CAS as well as some questions about the URL and hosting. He pointed us towards a project that will likely help us add CAS support. He also gave us the names of some other people we can contact for more information.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent We haven't had any problems this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Our plans for the coming week are to set up our database and get our project to the alpha stage. Our progress may be slightly behind where we should be, but we know what we need to do. There are not any concerns about the timeline.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We are continuing to work on developing the website. Personally, I'm waiting on the database portion to be finished so that I can adapt the file upload system.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent I'd like to see the website coming together a little quicker, but overall I'm not that worried about it.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Continue developing the site, finish the midterm report.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This week i am pretty busy about my midterm and team still working on winter term reporting until we receive the message that Kirsten pushes the due date to next week. For our project, I am starting to build the backend setup this Saturday. I will learn how to do it online while writing the backend setup. I will take a look at our report this weekend, start early for more time working on back-end build part.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent  Everything is good. Midterm finished this week. Project backend setup will keep going. The problems I am worried about is backend setup coding process, right now has too many bugs not fixed, I will try to finish it this weekend.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Figure out how to fix the backend coding bug and think about how to write winter term report.\\

\subsubsection{Week 7}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
Still working on the website and also working with Justin on setting up accounts for the CAS login system. \\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent  None really just need to get the team rolling on this project to hammer it out and to get the CAS login setup.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent Continue developing the app and work with Justin to finish up gathering the necessary information for the CAS login. \\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Added a new page, button, and text field. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Add more functionality, add more to the website, check up with group members on their progress, make a progress report.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
I had a midterm and a project for another class this week, so I didn't get much done on the project this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent We haven't had any problems this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent There are not any specific plans for the coming week. Just continuing the development. I'll probably try to get Django templates set up so that every page has a consistent design.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This week we continued work on the server. We have also contact the CAS team to get our website set up to use OSU's CAS login.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We plan to have the database done during the next week so that we can finish implementation. We would also like to have CAS setup by next week.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
I forget our meeting time is Wednesday this week since several assignments due this week. For our project, Team still waiting for the answer from our clients. We ask him about the AWS service building since our application interface still need it to complete. I am not busy this weekend and I will focus on our report, and keep working on back-end build part.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent  Everything is good. Project backend setup will keep going. Still waiting for the client response. And finish this winter report this weekend.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Figure out how to fix the database coding bug and quickly finish it before next week.\\

\subsubsection{Week 8}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
Currently we are still developing on the redesign while working on setting up personal AWS EC2 instances to prepare our app for deployment.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent None really just waiting for the necessary information to setup an EC2 instance through the university so that we can get a url to establish a CAS login. \\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent Continue to develop the functionality of our site so that we can have a smooth migration over to AWS.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Extracted values from text fields. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Don't know how to interact with our database.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Research into SQL databases, read more into Django documentation, look into other works.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This was a very busy week for me, so I did not get much of a chance to work on the project.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent I am having a few minor problems connecting to the database from Django, but it shouldn't be too difficult to figure it out.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent I plan on trying to connect to the default sqlite database to get the schedule working since our database is not yet finished.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This week we have continued our interaction with the OSU CAS team so that we can integrate their login system with our application.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Once we get CAS implemented, we can get our database setup to store account data.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
 I complete my Database design part this week, I will focus on the PHP setting this weekend. The entire work can be finish before next Tuesday. The team already got the answer from our clients. The Client recommends us to run the whole stack on EC2 or run the database on RDS. The team will get the free year to develop on AWS in the future. \\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent  According to the feedback of our winter term report, we need adding more screenshot on the interface part and reword some introduction in the project purpose part.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Figure out the video record work in next week. Correct the problem from the feedback classmate noticed. Review the other problems probably existed.\\

\subsubsection{Week 9}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
Just refining the pieces that we have for our project while we wait for information regarding the account.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent None yet just hoping to hear back from Justin.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent Keep refining our pieces and prepare to demo our project for the progress report.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Read up on Django documentation, still looking into redesigning the preferences page. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Test database functionality with the page.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
I connected the schedule to the development sqlite database. It doesn't support multiple users yet, but it should be relatively simple to add that functionality after we get the final database set up.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent The only problem we are having is getting the billing information for AWS. We are doing are development locally, so it isn't that big of a deal presently.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We are going to work on the database and further refine some of the pages. I want to make some adjustments to the model for the schedule to make it easier to switch to the final database when it is ready.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This week we are mostly waiting to hear back from our client so that we can get a billing number for our domain address to our website.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Once we get the domain address we can finish the CAS setup and get our application running with a CAS login.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
 we plan to modify our winter report according to the feedback from other classmates. They advise us to add more information about what we left. And they want more screenshot with the specific description on it. The team should start working on the improvement process and record video part in next week.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Right now, we looking good on the way of finishing the basic structure of our project. \\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent  Team getting Start working on the video record work. Also Reviewing the problem from the feedback and build final report template for the team.\\

\subsubsection{Week 10}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
We were able to get an account to finance a AWS instance which will soon be set up for prototyping.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent None now but setting up CAS could be a future issue during setup.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent The team is planning on completing the required progress report and video while also continuing development on our project.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Preferences are being saved. Working on displaying them out. \\ 

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Running out of time. Should probably spend more time.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Implement view of preferences. Might want different types of pages for these. The group is planning on meeting up and getting the project together over the weekend.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
I've been busy with projects for other classes, so I haven't done much during the last week. I started on an info page for letters the is linked to from the schedule. This gives more information about the letter such as what it is for and gives the instructor a place to upload the final letter.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent We haven't had any problems.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We are meeting up this weekend to put everything we have together and plan the video and report. We are also working on finding a time for the TA meetings next term.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This week we got the early stages of CAS setup. I'm working on setting up a temporary account system so that we can meet requirements for our project. Once we get CAS completely setup, then we can just integrate it with what we have.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We are meeting up this weekend to hammer out some details of the project, and I'll be compiling all the videos for our submission and turning them in.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Every part of the project already set, the team will put them together this Sunday. Also, we get the AWS account permission from the school. This weekend, we will work on AWS setting and process with our team leader since I don't have experience setting these things. Because the final report and video upload are due next Tuesday, the team will finish these things on Sunday for the extra time of other class final work.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent The potential problem I concerned still is AWS setting part since I don't have any experience on that. Because I have 4 exams next Monday to Wednesday, I would talk with my team leader this Sunday and make sure we can finish the project testing part well.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Team working on the video record work separately. The leader will collect each teammate work and put it together before the due date. Also Reviewing the problem from the feedback and finish the final report this Sunday.\\
