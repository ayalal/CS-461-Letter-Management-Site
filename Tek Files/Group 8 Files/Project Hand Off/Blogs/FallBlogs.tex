\subsection{Fall}
\subsubsection{Week 4}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
For Group 8 who is handling the letter of recommendation site, week 4 went great! I met up with our client to discuss the groups concept of the situation and solution for it which met up with the clients view as well. All members of the group worked with each other efficiently setting up meetings to discuss current/future documents and how we are going to handle responsibilities.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent In terms of problems I have none to report as the team members are very easy to get along with and are hard working.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent Future plans right now simply consist of continuing our work on future documents such as our requirements document and submitting the final version of our problem statement. Overall not to much to report at this moment but good progress and planning has been made.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
A couple of our members met up after class on Tuesday. I did not know they were doing that so unfortunately I was unable to attend. I sent an email requesting to meet up again on Thursday which we did. I got caught up with details about the client, the requirements, and our plans for our final draft of the problem statement. Lorenzo said that he would email us a final version of the problem statement report and told us to look over it whenever we could so we could talk about it during our meetup again with our TA on Friday. The final version looks good and we have done our work for this week. We have a functional github with all of our problem statements in there and we’re planning on using it as version control (just storing all of our stuff for the project in there).\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Will probably make contact to meet up again next week so we can draft a requirements document. We still haven’t made a final decision on what kind of language we want to use for this project as the client left it pretty open-ended for us to choose.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We met up as a team a couple of times this week to discuss the project in general as well as the final problem statement. We also met with Wesley, our TA on Friday.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent We have not had any problems yet.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We only have rough plans for the requirements document so far.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This week our group met up 3 times to discuss planning the project as well as writing the problem statement and the requirements document draft. We are meeting with Wesley, our TA, at the library today at 1500. We also heard back from our client, who met with Lorenzo, while the rest of us couldn't make that meeting due to conflict. We plan to meet with him possibly next week.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We plan to get started on the requirements doc this weekend and finish it next week.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
alk with teammates about our group final problem statement on Tuesday and Thursday. By summarizing our five members work we did last week, finally made a new one. Then, we talk with our group TA Wesley this Friday, ask him some question about what should we prepare for the future and he give us some advice about how can we do for the next document.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Lorenzo asks some questions about what our school service have that we need use for web design and any details that project needs to be considered like matrix design, networking connection.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent we plan to meet each other every week with flexible time. And discuss what should we do for the next assignment.\\

\subsubsection{Week 5}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
Sorry for the late post completely forgot about this. Progress is going good we are continuing on our documents for the course as required.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent No problems at all with the project so everything is going smoothly.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent In terms of plans we are just working on future documents which are required for our project and discussing the finer details as a group.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Lorenzo volunteered to take care of the requirements documentation. The due date was pushed back, so there’s no rush. We briefly discussed about the tech review and I went up with Lorenzo to ask the professor some clarifying questions about the tech review and requirements doc.  I was the only one who showed up to meet up with Wesley on Friday.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We can discuss the tech review next week with our entire group. We will look over the requirements documentation and turn that in whenever that’s due.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We have not done much this week other than begin work on the requirements document.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent A potential problem that we may have is for the technology reviews. Since our project is a website, we do not know how to break it into 15 pieces. It is a relatively simple and straightforward concept, so we have only been able to break it into about five pieces so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We will further discuss the tech review to try and break it up further.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We have a GitHub repo which includes our individual problem statement papers and tex files, as well as our group statement. We are meeting with our TA today at 1500, but I won't be able to attend this meeting as I have an event I need to be at during that time. We aim to be close to finishing the requirements draft on Monday, and finish the draft after Tuesday's class.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent As previously mentioned, we plan to have the requirements draft mostly complete by Monday.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
 Because I have the midterm on Friday, I would not meet our project, TA Wesley. Also, Ayala has family coming this Friday, the meeting of this week should be canceled. Because of the requirement document deadline extend to next Tuesday. Our team may talk about it online through google hangout this weekend. Then, start work on the next four day.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Some detail about database design like what we have on our website, still not make sense, I would ask TA in the next meeting time.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent finish requirement document before next Monday and maybe ask TA help us take look at our work. Prepare the Tech review draft1.\\

\subsubsection{Week 6}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
Currently everything is going well for the team and the project. we are all working on our necessary documents and have completed what was needed for this week. \\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent No issues have arose at all, everyone on the team gets a long pretty well which is great.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent Our plans for the following weeks are to continue working on our paper work as needed and meet up to define our project to smaller details.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Lorenzo finished the requirements documentation, we finished the team standards and we finished the tech review. \\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We can discuss about the project more in depth next week.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This was a relatively slow week for our team. We only met up in class on Tuesday to do the Team Standards activity. We were all on the same page with what to expect and do not foresee any major problems with communication. We briefly discussed the tech review, but since there are five of us, we accepted that there was going to be some overlap in topics. We made sure to do our own work though.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent We did not have any problems this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent Next week also looks like it is going to be pretty slow.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This week we completed the requirements draft as well as the individual tech reviews and the group expectations table, which we signed off on.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent I hope to get an early start on next week's work, and start doing some more research on some of the technologies I looked into while writing the tech review.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
 Our group makes the requirements document draft1 this week. We discuss the basic process about what we need prepare for future work. Also, think about how to modify our infrastructure if our customer has different requirements. Also, we made the team standards for everyone that make a foundation for planning future work. Because our project TA is busy, we haven't asked him any meeting time, we will make an appointment with him next week.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent Nothing special.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent  I am on the process of prepares the database flow chart since our main work is making the website management. If they have any advise, we can change it in time.\\

\subsubsection{Week 7}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
Sorry for yet another late submission I completely forgot about this again. Overall everything is going well the team has completed all recent assignments.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent There are no issues whatsoever the team works well together I still do not see any problems in the future.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent In terms of plans the team will soon begin working on the Design Document which will be released for week 8 and I believe things will go smoothly with the document as well.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Finished the tech review. Individual assignments meant we did not need to communicate with each other this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent No current plans. Can research about coding methods for the project on our own.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This was a slow week for us and we did not meet up at all. I only worked on the final draft of my Tech Review.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent We did not have any problems this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We will most likely meet next week to discuss the design document.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This week we worked individually on our tech reviews. We didn't get to meet with our TA today because he was busy today and unable to meet with any of his groups.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We plan to start looking into the design document once its module is available to be viewed.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
The main work this week is the individual Tech Review, and because our project just has a few technical elements need to consider. So, after we share the point with each teammate, we may write the same thing with different description when we doing the Tech Review. Also, the team leader doesn't tell us the next step, so, we may meet each other next week.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent The specific problem needs to be considered in Tech Review already solved in our class. Everything should be fine.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent meet team and project TA next week and take look at the Design Document this weekend.\\

\subsubsection{Week 8}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
For week 8 things still continue to go smoothly. With the release of the design document the group has had a brief of discussion on the documents organization and we will continue discussion on the progress of the document and writing responsibilities as well as the content to be included.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent Problems have not occurred at all and still do not see any to occur as the team gets a long very well together.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent Plans will continue to rotate around the design document as we progress to develop the document around our project and we will begin to develop the progress report document and media after completion of the design document.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Nothing to report.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We may plan on meeting to talk more about the project and see what other group members have done. An email may suffice as well.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
This was another slow week for us. We briefly discussed what we have been doing and some initial plans for the design document after class on Thursday. Other than that, we didn't do anything else this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent We did not have any problems this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We will most likely meet next week to discuss our current progress.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We didn't do much as a group this week, as there wasn't anything due.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We plan to look at the design document individually over this next week. We likely won't have a team meeting due to the week being so short. We will remain in communication electronically.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
 still on the process checking my Tech review have been graded, also spend some time reading technical support article about PHP and database design of web build to prepare my design document. And Ta asks us about the meeting time talking about the "problem statement" content supplement next week.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent  I still have no idea should we include what kind of web security level in our project. And I am not very familiar with web security. So, I may list some question about that.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent  Revised the article until it met with professor's satisfaction and read more article about web security.\\

\subsubsection{Week 9}

\textbf{Lorenzo Ayala}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
As of week 9 progress continues on the design document as all members work on their own segment of the document and discussion continues on the progress report which should be straight forward.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems you encountered:}\\
\noindent No problems have occurred yet and everything should still go smoothly as expected.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
\noindent Future plans consist of working on our design document and the progress report so that we can complete this terms assignments.\\

\noindent\textbf{Johnathan Lee}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
Week of Thanksgiving, progress is slowed. Haven’t exactly done anything this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent No problems so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We are making plans to help with the creation of the video that showcases our progress so far. Our design document is being worked on, we have decided that it won't be very hard to do as it seems to be mostly a compilation of the work we have done already.\\

\noindent\textbf{Matthew Kottre}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
I have not been on campus this week because I am home for Thanksgiving. We were not able to meet up because of this. I started working on the design document from the brief discussions we had after class on Thursday. I have not gotten very far on it yet and am planning on doing most of it this weekend.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent We did not have any problems this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We will discuss plans for the progress report video.\\

\noindent\textbf{Scott Waddington}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
We didn't meet this week since we had a really short week. We are looking over and starting the design document draft this weekend and we will meet as a group before it's due next week.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent None.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent We plan to meet early next week to finish up the design draft and look at the remaining assignments for the term.\\

\noindent\textbf{Mingwei Gao}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress:}\\
 The writing center only can make the one-hour appointment every time. That's not enough for my technical review modification. The writing center worker checked half of my file they ask me to come again next week. Also, I email my teammates ask their thought about the design document, still waiting for their response.\\

\noindent\textit{Problems:}\\
\noindent The design document hasn't started yet and still waiting for my teammate's feedback. I made the online word file shared with them. Moreover, create a basic framework for the team.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans:}\\
\noindent finish the technical review modification and submit our design document in time.\\
